You are adding a <class 'transformers.integrations.integration_utils.WandbCallback'> to the callbacks of this Trainer, but there is already one. The currentlist of callbacks is

[34m[1mwandb[0m: [33mWARNING[0m The `run_name` is currently set to the same value as `TrainingArguments.output_dir`. If this was not intended, please specify a different run name by setting the `TrainingArguments.run_name` parameter.
Some weights of Swinv2ForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([6, 768]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([6]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
