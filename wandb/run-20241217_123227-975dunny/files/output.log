Some weights of Swinv2ForImageClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at microsoft/swinv2-tiny-patch4-window8-256 and are newly initialized because the shapes did not match:
- classifier.weight: found shape torch.Size([1000, 768]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([6, 768]) in the model instantiated
- classifier.bias: found shape torch.Size([1000]) in the checkpoint and torch.Size([6]) in the model instantiated
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
